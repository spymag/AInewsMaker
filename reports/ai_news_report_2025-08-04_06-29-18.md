# Weekly AI and Tech News Summary (August 2025)

This week’s technological landscape is marked by significant developments in artificial intelligence, its societal implications, and geopolitical dimensions.

One of the most surprising findings pertains to AI behavior management. A study highlighted by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/01/1120924/forcing-llms-to-be-evil-during-training-can-make-them-nicer-in-the-long-run) suggests that intentionally exposing large language models (LLMs) to traits like evilness or sycophancy during training can paradoxically make them more ethical in the long run. This counterintuitive approach is part of ongoing efforts to improve AI alignment.

In the realm of human reproduction technology, a record-breaking milestone was reported by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/01/1120911/decades-old-frozen-embryos-are-changing-the-shape-of-families). A baby named Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born from an embryo frozen for over 30 years, exemplifying how decades-old frozen embryos are transforming familial and reproductive narratives worldwide.

Under the corporate spotlight, [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/31/1120885/the-two-people-shaping-the-future-of-openais-research/) detailed how OpenAI’s future research is being shaped by two key figures, amidst ongoing discussions about the platform's leadership and strategic direction. Meanwhile, [VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-open-source-ai-became-an-american-national-priority/) emphasized a renewed push by the U.S. to prioritize open-source AI development, asserting that democratizing AI not only aligns with democratic principles but is crucial for maintaining global leadership.

On the technological front, new AI models continue to push boundaries. Cohere unveiled a vision model capable of running on just two GPUs, outperforming top-tier visual language models on certain visual tasks ([VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-vision-model-from-cohere-runs-on-two-gpus-beats-top-tier-vlms-on-visual-tasks)). Meanwhile, Google released its Olympiad-winning Gemini 2.5 ‘Deep Think’ AI to the public, albeit in a less powerful version intended for general users ([VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-releases-olympiad-medal-winning-gemini-2-5-deep-think-ai-publicly-but-theres-a-catch…)). However, security concerns persist, including a recent vulnerability in the Gemini CLI tool that could enable hackers to execute malicious commands ([Ars Technica AI](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/flaw-in-gemini-cli-coding-tool-allowed-hackers-to-run-nasty-commands-on-user-devices/)).

The global political landscape features increasing AI-related export and security tensions. Nvidia has been permitted to sell AI chips to China after addressing security concerns regarding potential backdoors, raising questions about the security of AI infrastructure in strategic regions ([The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/707100/nvidia-says-it-can-sell-ai-chips-to-china-again)). Additionally, Russian hackers are reportedly targeting foreign embassies with sophisticated malware, including Raspberry Pi devices equipped with 4G modules for covert operations ([Ars Technica AI](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/microsoft-catches-russian-hackers-targeting-foreign-embassies/)).

On the economic side, tech giants continue to demonstrate impressive financial strength. Microsoft reported Q4 earnings surpassing expectations, with Azure revenue exceeding $75 billion, and plans to invest an additional $30 billion in AI infrastructure next quarter ([The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/716191/microsoft-q4-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface)). Notably, top AI researchers are earning sums comparable to historic scientific endeavors, with salaries reaching up to $250 million annually, dwarfing past achievements such as the Manhattan Project ([Ars Technica AI](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/at-250-million-top-ai-salaries-dwarf-those-of-the-manhattan-project-and-the-space-race)).

Finally, ethical and security challenges remain paramount. The viral spread of logs from ChatGPT has exposed confidential disclosures, including criminal confessions and trade secrets ([The Verge AI](https://www.digitaldigging.org/p/the-chatgpt-confession-files)). This, coupled with recent security flaws such as vulnerabilities in AI coding tools potentially allowing malicious commands, underscores the importance of robust safeguards in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

**Conclusion:** The period marks both remarkable technological advancements and ongoing concerns surrounding security, geopolitics, and societal impacts. As AI continues to embed itself deeper into economic and social structures, careful regulation, security, and transparency remain critical priorities.
