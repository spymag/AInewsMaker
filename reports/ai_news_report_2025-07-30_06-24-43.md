# Weekly Tech & AI Developments: Record-Breaking Baby, AI Education, and Energy Innovations

This week has seen remarkable advancements across diverse fields, from biology to artificial intelligence, energy storage, and cybersecurity.

**Biological Milestone:**  
A groundbreaking development in reproductive science was reported by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120769/exclusive-record-breaking-baby-born-embryo-over-30-years-old/). A baby boy, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, was born having developed from an embryo stored for over 30 years, setting a new record for the “oldest embryo” used to produce a live birth. The baby is reportedly healthy, highlighting potential breakthroughs in embryo preservation techniques.

**AI in Education:**  
OpenAI is launching a new version of ChatGPT tailored for college students, called **Study Mode** ([MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120801/openai-is-launching-a-version-of-chatgpt-for-college-students/); [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpt-just-got-smarter-openais-study-mode-helps-students-learn-step-by-step/); [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/715493/openai-chatgpt-ai-study-mode-answer)). Unlike previous iterations, this mode aims to act as an interactive tutor, guiding students through problem-solving processes with prompts and quizzes, moving away from simple answer provision. This initiative reflects a broader push to integrate AI more deeply into educational settings.

**Energy Storage Innovations:**  
A Texas-based startup, Quidnet Energy, has demonstrated a novel underground water-pumping method capable of storing energy for up to six months ([MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120771/the-download-how-to-store-energy-underground-and-what-you-may-not-know-about-trumps-ai-action-plan/); [VentureBeat](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120765/earth-battery-quidnet/)). By utilizing the Earth as a massive battery through water pumping and storage, this technology could provide a low-cost and long-duration energy storage solution, crucial for renewable integration.

**U.S. AI Policy & Development:**  
The White House under Donald Trump has emphasized an ambitious AI agenda, aiming to surpass China’s AI developments, eliminate "woke" biases in AI models, and expand AI infrastructure ([MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120760/what-you-may-have-missed-about-trumps-ai-action-plan/)). Details remain sparse, but the focus indicates significant government backing for AI growth and regulation.

**Cybersecurity & AI Chips:**  
VentureBeat reports that Prophet Security has secured $30 million to develop autonomous AI cybersecurity solutions capable of faster threat responses with fewer false positives ([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-vs-ai-prophet-security-raises-30m-to-replace-human-analysts-with-autonomous-defenders/)). Meanwhile, Positron is working on AI inference chips meant to compete with Nvidia, leveraging U.S.-fabricated components to meet enterprise needs ([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/positron-believes-it-has-found-the-secret-to-take-on-nvidia-in-ai-inference-chips-heres-how-it-could-benefit-enterprises/)).

**Additional Highlights:**  
- OpenAI’s **GPT-5** might be released as soon as August, promising enhanced reasoning and broader capabilities ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openais-most-capable-ai-model-gpt-5-may-be-coming-in-august/)).  
- AI's growing presence extends into unconventional areas, such as Meta allowing job candidates to use AI during coding tests ([The Verge](https://www.404media.co/meta-is-going-to-let-job-candidates-use-ai-during-coding-tests/)), and AI tools being employed in headphone controls ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/18/11261586/bragi-dash-review-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds)).  
- Not all AI news is positive; pro-Ukrainian hackers claimed responsibility for a cyber attack disrupting Russian flights, and new ransomware groups like Chaos are emerging following takedowns of previous groups ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/after-blacksuit-is-taken-down-new-ransomware-group-chaos-emerges/)).  
- In another notable story, AI-generated content was used to produce a false obituary that incorrectly listed Wesley LePatner’s age, highlighting current limitations and challenges in AI-generated information accuracy ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/blackstone-says-wesley-lepatner-killed-in-monday-shooting)).  

**In summary**, technological progress continues at a rapid pace, with breakthroughs in biology, energy storage, and AI, alongside ongoing cybersecurity challenges. Governments, startups, and tech giants are deeply invested in shaping a future where AI plays an increasingly integral role across diverse sectors.
