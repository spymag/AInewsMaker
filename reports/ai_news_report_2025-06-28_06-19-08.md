# Weekly Tech & AI News Roundup – June 2025

The technology landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with notable developments spanning AI innovation, energy sustainability, and regulatory responses. 

**AI Data Center Sustainability and Energy Innovations**  
Redwood Materials, a leading battery recycling firm, has repurposed old EV batteries to power AI data centers in Reno, Nevada, showcasing a novel approach to sustainable energy use in AI infrastructure ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/26/1119402/this-battery-recycling-company-is-now-cleaning-up-ai-data-centers/)). This move aligns with broader efforts to mitigate the environmental footprint of data centers, especially amid summer heatwaves stressing the US power grid ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/26/1119358/summer-grid-ai-air-conditioning/)). As climate challenges intensify, AI-driven heat management and renewable energy solutions gain prominence.

**Advancements in AI and Biotechnology**  
Google’s DeepMind has announced a groundbreaking AI capable of decoding gene functions, promising to accelerate genetic research ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/26/1119379/the-download-google-deepminds-dna-ai-and-heatwaves-impact-on-the-grid/)). Additionally, AI models are now integrated into biotech and health sectors, with companies like Anthropic digitizing vast libraries of books for training their models, although this has raised questions over copyright and data rights ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/)).

**AI in Business and Consumer Tech**  
Retailer David’s Bridal is pivoting to AI-driven personalization and knowledge graph technologies to revive its business after double bankruptcy ([VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/retail-resurrection-davids-bridal-bets-its-future-on-ai-after-double-bankruptcy/)). Meanwhile, new consumer-facing AI products are emerging, including Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe’s upcoming AI glasses, hinting at next-generation embedded AI devices ([The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/621022/sesame-voice-assistant-ai-glasses-oculus-brendan-iribe)).

**Security Challenges & Regulatory Measures**  
AI security continues to be a critical concern, with vulnerabilities in server management tools like AMD’s AMI MegaRAC exposing thousands of servers to active exploitation ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/active-exploitation-of-ami-management-tool-imperils-thousands-of-servers/)). Additionally, regulators in Denmark are proposing copyright amendments granting citizens ownership rights over their likenesses and voices, aiming to combat deepfakes and unauthorized AI content ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/deepfakes-denmark-copyright-law-artificial-intelligence)).

**Emerging Trends in AI Development & Regulation**  
The industry is witnessing a shift towards **model minimalism**, where smaller AI models are favored for reducing operational costs while maintaining efficiency ([VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/model-minimalism-the-new-ai-strategy-saving-companies-millions)). There’s also increased scrutiny of AI training data; lawsuits and regulatory cases against companies like Meta and Microsoft highlight the ongoing debates over data legality and fair use in AI development ([The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/693437/meta-ai-copyright-win-fair-use-warning)).

**Industry Recognition & Innovation**  
At the VB Transform 2025 conference, startups like CTGT and Catio garnered awards for their innovative approaches—trust-enhancing AI customization and multi-agent conversational systems, respectively ([VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ctgt-wins-best-presentation-style-award-at-vb-transform-2025/), [VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/catio-wins-coolest-tech-award-at-vb-transform-2025/)).

As AI and related technologies press forward, challenges surrounding security, ethics, and environmental impact remain front and center. The coming months will be pivotal in shaping how industries adopt, regulate, and innovate around these powerful tools.
