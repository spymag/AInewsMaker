# AI News Report for 2025-08-26

## Climate risk and disaster cost measurement
MIT Technology Review highlights lidar as a key tool for quantifying the rising cost of climate-driven disasters. The January 2025 Los Angeles-area wildfires—Eaton and Palisades—burned for 24 days, killed 29 people, destroyed 16,000 structures, and produced losses around $60 billion, with more than 55,000 acres consumed and lasting landscape transformation. The piece argues lidar-enabled analyses help map exposure and damages with unprecedented granularity.

## AI energy use, DNA data, and privacy concerns
MIT Technology Review’s The Download reports on Google’s release of energy-use data for Gemini AI queries, detailing per-query energy expenditure across its apps. The same outlet also features a personal account on adding one’s DNA profile to a private genealogy database and authorizing police searches, underscoring ongoing tensions between convenience, civil liberties, and investigative power.

## The case against humans in space
MIT Technology Review weighs a growing debate about human space exploration, contrasting the ambitions of prominent space advocates with arguments that settling space may not be the existential priority some claim. The piece situates Musk and Bezos within a broader skepticism about the inevitability and practicality of space colonization.

## AI testing, productivity tools, and open-source agents
VentureBeat AI covers multiple angles on AI capability and tooling: a blind-test website lets users compare GPT-5 and GPT-4o without model identification, revealing preference patterns; MCP (multi-context programmable) could boost developer productivity by integrating AI coding assistants with core tools; and OpenCUA’s open-source computer-use agents aim to rival proprietary models, offering accessible alternatives for building AI-enabled workflows.

## Corporate moves, revenue strategies, and regulatory tension
The Verge’s AI desk reports a wave of strategic moves and legal actions shaping the industry: Meta is partnering with Midjourney and intends to license its technology for future models and products, a development that could influence enterprise APIs and product lines. Separately, Elon Musk’s xAI has filed lawsuits against OpenAI and Apple, challenging perceived monopolistic dynamics; CNBC and related coverage note xAI quietly shed its public-benefit corporation status before May 2024, reducing formal societal reporting obligations. Perplexity is expanding a publisher-revenue-sharing program for AI searches, and Bloomberg notes Apple is exploring using Google Gemini to power a revamped Siri. Court filings reveal Musk also approached Mark Zuckerberg about OpenAI investments, though no deal was signed.

## Emerging risks and social dynamics in AI
Ars Technica highlights regulatory and ethical frictions as cybersecurity breaches and rapid AI deployment collide with public trust. A separate analysis questions whether AI chatbots accelerate grandiose but unproven claims, while a quirky project demonstrates an AI trained on 19th-century texts unexpectedly comments on 1834 protests. Other pieces question whether the AI funding cycle is sustainable at current highs and explore whether AI may outpace human oversight.
