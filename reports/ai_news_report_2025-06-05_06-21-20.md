# Technology & AI Industry Highlights – June 2025

Recent developments across the technology and AI sectors reveal both innovations and ongoing concerns. The [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/04/1117864/mit-technology-review-insiders-panel/) has launched its Insiders Panel, fostering dialogue on future trends. Notably, discussions are intensifying around AI’s expanding role in mathematics and energy consumption. A series of articles explore "what’s next" for AI and math, emphasizing stagnation in mathematical methodologies and launching initiatives like DARPA’s expMath project aimed at updating foundational math tools ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/04/1117753/whats-next-for-ai-and-math/)). 

Simultaneously, there's a push for optimism regarding AI’s energy footprint. One [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/03/1117693/the-download-reasons-to-be-optimistic-about-ais-energy-use-and-caiwei-chens-three-things/) article highlights four reasons for hope, including advancements in measuring and reducing AI’s carbon costs. Investigations into AI's energy use are ongoing, with efforts detailed in a [VentureBeat](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/03/1117685/inside-the-tedious-effort-to-tally-ais-energy-appetite/) piece that describes the meticulous process of quantifying AI’s environmental impact.

On the policy and societal front, the **U.S.** has restructured its AI oversight agencies, renaming the AI Safety Institute to the **Center for AI Standards and Innovation**, aiming to ensure U.S. dominance in setting AI standards ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/679852/trump-ai-safety-institute-name-mission-change)). Despite some skepticism, Hollywood studios are reportedly increasing their use of generative AI, though behind closed doors due to public backlash ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23770133/secret-invasion-ai-credits-marvel)). Additionally, **Google** introduced a new AI-powered feature in Google Workspace to streamline review processes with a “Catch me up” shortcut, cautioning users about potential inaccuracies ([The Verge](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/06/catch-me-up-in-google-drive.html)).

Security and privacy concerns persist, with **Ars Technica** reporting the removal of two certificate authorities from Google's trusted list due to trust issues ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/chrome-boots-2-certificate-authorities-citing-a-lack-of-trust-and-confidence/)). Further, companies like **Meta** and **Yandex** are de-anonymizing Android web browsing, raising privacy alarms ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/)). Meanwhile, **Broadcom** is pulling out of business with lower-tier VMware partners, citing lack of engagement, and **German law enforcement** has reportedly identified the leader of Trickbot, a notorious ransomware group ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/broadcom-ends-business-with-vmwares-lowest-tier-channel-partners/); [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/german-police-say-theyve-identified-trickbot-ransomware-kingpin/)).

AI-generated content continues to improve rapidly. **Veo 3** by Google offers remarkably realistic AI-crafted videos of human figures, raising ethical concerns about realism and potential misuse ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/)). As AI tools grow more sophisticated, discussions about regulation, safety, and ethical deployment are intensifying, shaping the future landscape of AI technology worldwide.
