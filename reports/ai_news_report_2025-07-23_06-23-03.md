# Tech & AI Landscape Update: July 2025

**Environmental Innovation Advances**  
A Michigan-based startup, **[Enspired Solutions](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1117638/fighting-forever-chemicals-and-startup-fatigue/)**, is tackling the pervasive presence of PFAS "forever chemicals" in water supplies, aiming for permanent removal solutions. Separately, **[Quaise](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1120545/geothermal-drilling-quaise/)** has developed an unconventional, energy-based drilling system that uses beams of energy to melt rocks for geothermal energy extraction, promising a more efficient and less invasive approach to accessing geothermal resources.

**Artificial Intelligence: Innovations and Challenges**  
AI continues to evolve rapidly, with notable breakthroughs and ongoing debates. **[Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/mixture-of-recursions-delivers-2x-faster-inference-heres-how-to-implement-it/)** has emerged as a promising architecture that doubles inference speed while reducing computational costs and memory requirements. However, research from **[Anthropic](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-researchers-discover-the-weird-ai-problem-why-thinking-longer-makes-models-dumber/)** reveals a surprising limitation: extending reasoning time can impair model performance, challenging assumptions that longer thinking enhances AI accuracy.

**Data Privacy and Security Concerns**  
The proliferation of AI training data raises privacy alarms. **[The Download](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/21/1120525/the-download-how-your-data-is-being-used-to-train-ai-and-why-chatbots-arent-doctors/)** highlights that large datasets used for AI training often include personal documents like passports and IDs, sparking privacy concerns. Meanwhile, cybersecurity threats persist. A **[SharePoint vulnerability](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/sharepoint-vulnerability-with-9-8-severity-rating-is-under-exploit-across-the-globe/)** with a 9.8 severity rating is actively exploited worldwide, enabling credential theft.

**Corporate AI Deployments & Open-Source Tools**  
Major corporations deepen AI integration. **[Microsoft’s](https://www.theverge.com/news/711797/windows-11-microsoft-ai-features-copilot-vision-launch)** upcoming Windows 11 update will incorporate AI features like **Copilot Vision**, enabling screen-scanning and enhanced user interaction. On the open-source front, **[Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-2507-beats-kimi-2-and-offers-low-compute-version/)** from Alibaba offers scalable AI models that can run on single GPUs, making powerful AI more accessible.

**AI in Competitive & Ethical Contexts**  
In competitive arenas, a human coder **[defeated an AI model](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/exhausted-man-defeats-ai-model-in-world-coding-championship/)** in a 10-hour world coding competition, highlighting ongoing limitations of AI in complex tasks. Additionally, recent revelations from **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/global-affairs/new-economic-analysis/)** show over five million ChatGPT users generate billions of messages daily, mostly for learning and communication, signaling the platform’s integral role in daily activities.

**Ethical & Societal Perspectives**  
Discussions around AI's societal impacts continue. A report from **[The Verge](https://mirage.app/state-of-deepfakes-2025)** examines the state of deepfakes and synthetic humans, underscoring both technological progress and potential misuse. Moreover, investigations into government surveillance and privacy, such as **[EFF's](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/eff-moves-to-stop-power-utility-reporting-suspected-pot-growers-to-cops/)** critique of utility companies reporting suspected drug growers, reflect ongoing tensions between security and civil liberties.

**In conclusion**, the tech and AI ecosystem in July 2025 is marked by groundbreaking innovations across environmental solutions, AI enhancements, and accessibility improvements, alongside persistent challenges related to privacy, security, and ethical use. As these developments unfold, stakeholders across sectors must navigate the fine balance between progress and responsible deployment.
