# Weekly Tech and AI News Roundup

This week’s technological landscape is marked by breakthroughs in AI, cybersecurity challenges, and evolving public debates around digital content and privacy.

**AI and Chatbot Developments**  
New research indicates that certain AI companions, such as DeepSeek, are notably more willing to engage in controversial conversations, including explicit topics, compared to other chatbots like Replika [[MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/20/1119066/ai-chatbot-dirty-talk-deepseek-replika/)]. This raises questions about moderation and ethical use of AI in intimate contexts.

**AI Regulation and Transparency**  
The lack of transparency around advanced models like Google’s Gemini continues to develop concerns among developers. Google’s decision to hide reasoning traces from its Gemini AI is stirring debate over the transparency of "black-box" models versus the need for accountability [[VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gemini-transparency-cut-leaves-enterprise-developers-debugging-blind/)]. Meanwhile, Google is also expanding Gemini’s capabilities, including new features for video analysis, signaling broader application potential [[VentureBeat AI](https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/gemini-app-video-upload/)].

**Cybersecurity and Cyber Warfare**  
Cyberattacks remain a significant threat, with a record-breaking DDoS attack reaching 7.3Tbps, flooding targets with massive junk traffic in seconds [[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/)]. In the geopolitical arena, hackers linked to Israel are actively waging cyberwar against Iran’s financial infrastructure, successfully eroding over $90 million from Iranian crypto exchanges [[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/israel-tied-predatory-sparrow-hackers-are-waging-cyberwar-on-iran’s-financial-system/)]. Additionally, hospitals are increasingly targeted with ransomware and cyber-attacks costing hospitals up to $600,000 per hour, with AI tools being employed to bolster defenses [[VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/security/hospital-cyber-attacks-cost-600k-hour-heres-how-ai-is-changing-the-math/)].

**Content and Data Archiving**  
A movement to archive pre-AI-human-generated content is gaining traction, with efforts to preserve knowledge from before AI contamination, particularly sources untouched by models like ChatGPT [[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/why-one-man-is-archiving-human-made-content-from-before-the-ai-explosion/)]]. This initiative aims to safeguard historical context amid rapidly evolving AI environments.

**Corporate and Market Dynamics**  
Major tech companies are exploring expansion and acquisitions: Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta reportedly held talks to acquire multiple AI firms, including Thinking Machines and Perplexity, as he seeks to reboot his AI strategy [[The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/690720/meta-buy-thinking-machines-perplexity-safe-superintelligence)]. Similarly, French startup Mistral updated its open-source AI model to a more powerful version aligned with EU regulations [https://venturebeat.com/ai/mistral-just-updated-its-open-source-small-model-from-3-1-to-3-2-heres-why/].

**Legal and Ethical Challenges**  
The BBC has issued a legal warning to AI startup Perplexity over content scraping, alleging that the chatbot is regurgitating BBC material without authorization, marking a significant step in IP enforcement against AI firms [[The Verge AI](https://www.ft.com/content/b743d401-dc5d-44b8-9987-825a4ffcf4ca)].

**Emerging Technologies**  
New tools like the "Orb" iris scanner aim to verify human users via a blockchain-based identity system, potentially reducing AI bot impersonation on platforms like Reddit, which is considering adopting human verification measures [[The Verge AI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273691/world-orb-sam-altman-iris-scan-crypto-token)]].

**Policy and Regulation**  
Finally, a presidential executive order has rolled back recent cybersecurity measures, with key provisions including secure software mandates and quantum-resistant cryptography being removed, signaling a potential shift in U.S. cybersecurity priorities [[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/cybersecurity-take-a-big-hit-in-new-trump-executive-order/)].
