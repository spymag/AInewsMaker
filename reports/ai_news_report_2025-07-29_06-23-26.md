# Weekly Tech and AI News Wrap-up

This week’s tech headlines highlight significant developments across global AI initiatives, cybersecurity, climate programs, and pharma controversies.

### Shifts in Chinese Education and AI Use
Chinese universities are revising their stance on AI, encouraging students to leverage AI tools rather than avoid them. Two years ago, students faced restrictions on AI usage; now, institutions aim to integrate AI into learning. For example, [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/28/1120752/the-download-how-chinas-universities-approach-ai-and-the-pitfalls-of-welfare-algorithms/) reports that students like Lorraine He, a law student, previously bypassed bans on ChatGPT by using mirror sites, but current policies promote more open AI engagement.

### US Climate and Data Preservation Efforts
Amid concerns over federal rollback of climate initiatives, nonprofits and academia are actively working to preserve and modernize greenhouse gas measurement systems. This effort, detailed by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120636/how-nonprofits-and-academia-are-stepping-up-to-salvage-us-climate-programs/), emphasizes the role of organizations like the Data Foundation in advocating for open data, countering potential obfuscation caused by political shifts.

### Pharma Controversies: Gene Therapy Concerns
The gene therapy Elevidys, approved for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, faces scrutiny after being linked to recent patient fatalities, as reported by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/25/1120621/deadly-saga-controversial-gene-therapy-elevidys/). This controversy raises questions about the safety protocols surrounding experimental treatments.

### Advances and Challenges in AI
The AI landscape continues to evolve rapidly:
- [VentureBeat AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chinese-startup-z-ai-launches-powerful-open-source-glm-4-5-model-family-with-powerpoint-creation/) highlights Chinese startup Z.ai’s release of the open-source GLM-4.5 model, capable of tasks like PowerPoint creation, offering enterprise-grade customization.
- Search interfaces are becoming more AI-driven, with [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-more-links-no-more-scrolling-the-browser-is-becoming-an-ai-agent/) discussing how browsers are shifting from traditional link-based searches to task-oriented AI agents.
- Major players like Anthropic are tightening rate limits on models like Claude, provoking customer backlash ([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-throttles-claude-rate-limits-devs-call-foul/)). Meanwhile, AI infrastructure startups such as E2B are thriving, serving 88% of Fortune 100 firms and raising $21 million ([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-e2b-became-essential-to-88-of-fortune-100-companies-and-raised-21-million/)).

### Browser and Security Innovations
Google announced the rollout of AI in UK Search, with AI-enhanced features like star ratings and summaries ([The Verge AI](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/ai-mode-search-uk/)). Meanwhile, [Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/news/714435/microsoft-edge-copilot-mode-ai-features) has integrated Copilot Mode into Edge, enhancing browsing with AI assistance.

### Cybersecurity Threats and Vulnerabilities
Cyber threats persist: Apple’s Spotlight security flaw (CVE-2025-31199) was patched but could have allowed unauthorized access to sensitive data ([Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/28/sploitlight-analyzing-a-spotlight-based-macos-tcc-vulnerability/)). Additionally, supply-chain attacks on open-source software continue to escalate, affecting nearly 2.8 million downloads weekly ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/open-source-repositories-are-seeing-a-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks/)).

### Geopolitical and Cyber Vigilance
Cyberattacks linked to geopolitical tensions include a pro-Ukrainian hacking operation that disrupted Russian flight schedules ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/pro-ukrainian-hackers-take-credit-for-attack-that-snarls-russian-flight-travel/)). Furthermore, the emergence of new ransomware groups like Chaos after BlackSuit's takedown underscores ongoing cybercriminal activity ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/after-blacksuit-is-taken-down-new-ransomware-group-chaos-emerges/)).

### AI Model Advancements
Speculation suggests OpenAI’s next-gen GPT-5 could debut as early as August, promising enhanced reasoning capabilities ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openais-most-capable-ai-model-gpt-5-may-be-coming-in-august/)).
