# Weekly Technology and AI Developments Summary

This week, significant advancements and concerns across AI, environmental initiatives, and geopolitical implications are shaping the tech landscape.

### AI-Assisted Archaeology and Scientific Innovation
Google DeepMind has launched a groundbreaking AI, **[Aeneas](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/23/1120574/deepmind-ai-aeneas-helps-historians-interpret-latin-inscriptions/)**, capable of deciphering weathered Latin inscriptions, aiding historians in uncovering contextual clues from ancient relics. This build on Google's previous archaeological tools highlights AI's expanding role in heritage preservation.

In the energy sector, **[Quaise](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1120545/geothermal-drilling-quaise/)** is innovating geothermal drilling by deploying energy beams to melt through rocky formations, a technique aiming to boost sustainable energy extraction. Similarly, Michigan startup **[Enspired Solutions](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1117638/fighting-forever-chemicals-and-startup-fatigue/)** is tackling persistent environmental toxins like PFAS chemicals, aiming for permanent removal from water sources.

### AI Infrastructure and Safety Measures
The Biden administration's **[AI Action Plan](https://venturebeat.com/ai/white-house-plan-signals-open-weight-first-era-and-enterprises-need-new-guardrails/)** signals a shift towards open-source AI models, though immediate impacts are still developing. Meanwhile, efforts to ensure safe deployment of AI include **[AI insurance](https://venturebeat.com/ai/former-anthropic-exec-raises-15m-to-insure-ai-agents-and-help-startups-deploy-safely/)**, with a startup securing $15M to insure AI agents and promote safer venture deployments.

On the technical front, **[Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/mixture-of-recursions-delivers-2x-faster-inference-heres-how-to-implement-it/)** has emerged as a promising architecture capable of doubling inference speed while reducing memory and cost — a potential game-changer in large language model (LLM) efficiency. Additionally, **[Qwen3-Coder](https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct-launches-and-it-might-be-the-best-coding-model-yet/)** introduces innovative customization for developers, allowing dynamic invocation of tools during code generation.

### Geopolitical and Regulatory Shifts
The US government appears to have softened its stance toward chipmakers, with **[Nvidia](https://www.theverge.com/news/712753/trump-nvidia-jensen-huang-break-up-chips-ai)**'s CEO Jensen Huang successfully persuading former President Trump to shelve plans to break up Nvidia, emphasizing the company's strategic importance in the AI and chip industry.

Conversely, concerns over data security and security vulnerabilities are escalating. Notably, **[SharePoint vulnerabilities](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/sharepoint-vulnerability-with-9-8-severity-rating-is-under-exploit-across-the-globe/)** are being actively exploited worldwide, with high-severity security issues allowing credential theft. The **[Toolshell threat](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/what-to-know-about-toolshell-the-sharepoint-threat-under-mass-exploitation/)** exemplifies the ongoing risks in enterprise software, prompting calls for heightened security vigilance.

### AI in Public Policy and Ethics
In the US, **[RFK Jr.](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/697129/rfk-jr-ai)** has championed an "AI revolution," but reports suggest existing AI tools like Elsa, designed to expedite pharmaceutical approvals, are underperforming—misrepresenting data and wasting investigators' time. Similarly, the **[Stargate project](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348816/openai-softbank-ai-data-center-stargate-project)** hints at a major private-sector investment, totaling an estimated $500 billion, into AI infrastructure.

### AI-Generated Content and Deepfakes
The evolution of synthetic media continues with the **[State of Deepfakes 2025](https://mirage.app/state-of-deepfakes-2025)** reporting on advancements in AI-generated videos and realistic synthetic humans. Meanwhile, **[GitHub Spark](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-23-github-spark-in-public-preview-for-copilot-pro-subscribers/?utm_source=Twitter/X&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=CL-Spark-X)**, now in public preview, allows developers to build full-stack AI applications from plain descriptions, lowering barriers to AI app development.

### Infrastructure and Global AI Projects
OpenAI and partners are constructing a massive data center in Texas, dubbed the **[Stargate project](https://theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348816/openai-softbank-ai-data-center-stargate-project)**, reflecting the scale and ambition of current AI infrastructure efforts.

**In summary**, the AI sector continues to accelerate with innovations in archaeology, energy, and development tools, while simultaneously confronting pressing security, regulatory, and geopolitical challenges. As AI's footprint grows, balancing technological progress with safety and ethical considerations remains paramount.
